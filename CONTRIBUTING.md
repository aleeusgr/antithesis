# Contributing to Antithesis

Thank you for considering contributing to Antithesis and help the Cardano community improve the security of the network!

At this stage, the main focus of the project is to evaluate [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com) and how the Cardano community could benefit from it.
We won't be able to accept code contributions _yet_ but hope to open that possibility very quickly

Meanwhile, contributions do not need to take the form of actual code, but could have many shapes, and you're welcome providing feedback and suggest improvements about the project:

* Improvements, additions, fixes to the documentation and reports provided,
* Bug reports, ideas, suggestions,
* Translations,
* ...
